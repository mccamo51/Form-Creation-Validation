# My First Portfolio

Welcome to my first HTML/CSS/JavaScript portfolio project! This repository showcases a series of tasks designed to demonstrate my understanding of building webpages using semantic HTML.

## Learning Objectives

Through this project, I have achieved the following:

- Gained an understanding of HTML and its role in browsers.
- Created valid HTML pages using semantic tags.
- Learned to use elements, attributes, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
- Embedded external media, such as images and tweets.
- Structured content with tags like `<table>`, `<article>`, and `<aside>`.
- Built a personal portfolio to showcase my projects and contact information.

## Tasks Completed

1. **Basic Structure**
   - Created a valid HTML file with DOCTYPE, `<head>` (including `<title>`), and `<body>` tags.

2. **Cool First Webpage**
   - Added headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`), paragraphs, and a clickable image.

3. **Cool Other Webpage**
   - Embedded a tweet and created links to and from the main page.

4. **Website Consistency**
   - Structured `index.html` and `tweets.html` using `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` for consistent layout.
   - Implemented navigation and placeholder content.

5. **Creative Table Addition**
   - Added a table listing learner information using `<thead>` and `<tbody>` within an `<article>` tag.

6. **Personal Portfolio**
   - Developed a standalone portfolio webpage with Introduction, Projects, About Me, and Contact sections.
   - Utilized semantic HTML and included external links to GitHub and LinkedIn.

## Tools & Guidelines

- **Editor Used:** Visual Studio Code
- **Validator:** All HTML files validated using the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
- **Restrictions:** No external libraries or frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap, React, Vue) were used.
